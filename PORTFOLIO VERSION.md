# üß† BYOB Botnet Lab ‚Äì Practical Deployment, Debugging & DDoS Simulation

## üìò Overview

A self-contained cybersecurity lab project exploring botnet architecture, payload deployment, and DDoS simulation using the open-source **BYOB (Build Your Own Botnet)** framework. Focused on offensive techniques in a private and ethical environment.

---

## üåü Highlights

- Deployed and configured BYOB with custom Python payloads
- Selected Web GUI for easier botnet control vs. CLI
- Debugged C2-server communication issues due to NAT and port blocking
- Discovered that company-owned router prevented required port forwarding
- Planned DDoS simulation using a lightweight Python script (**Sapphire**)
- Used Tails Linux, Tor, and ProxyChains to research underground tools securely

**Project halted due to:**

- üîí Router restrictions (no port forwarding access)
- ‚öñÔ∏è Insufficient scale (2‚Äì3 VMs not enough for realistic DDoS)

## üõ† Tools & Environment

- **Languages:** Python
- **Framework:** BYOB (Botnet)
- **Lab OS:** Kali Linux (VirtualBox)
- **Research OS:** Tails Linux (Live Boot)
- **Privacy Stack:** Tor, ProxyChains, Tor Bridges
- **Script (researched):** Sapphire ‚Äì Python-based DDoS tool
